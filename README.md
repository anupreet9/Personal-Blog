Personal Blog 

## Description

This is a fully functional responsive personal blog where a viewer can see posts, like them, and comment on them. A viewer can contact the blogger by simply filling out a form, subscribe to the blog's newsletter, and share the blog on social media. When the user subscribes to the blog, they get an email to confirm their email address and once they verify, they get a welcome email.

The blog's administrator can see all of their written posts, add blog posts, edit and delete them. As for the comments made by the viewer on the post, an admin can approve them to make them visible on the post, write a reply to the comment, edit the comment, mark it as spam or delete them. An admin can also send their subscribers email newsletter, reply to their query email, create email templates, add or edit templates and even delete their subscribers manually. An admin even gets an email when a viewer comments on the post or asks a  query.
